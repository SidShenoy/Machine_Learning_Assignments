## Decision Tree Learning
1. Using ID3 algorithm
2. Using Random Forest algorithm
3. Using Reduced Error Pruning algorithm

## Candidate Elimination Algorithm
Used to find the target concept. If the target-attribute has more than 2 possible values, the output consists of the version space for each possible target attribute value.
